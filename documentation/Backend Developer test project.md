## Project Details

`Company X` is a B2B E-commerce company and would like to proceed with a build of a bespoke Laravel / angular website.  `Company X` has kindly provided 2 csv files to help start the data migration from their old system to the start of this new project.

Your task is to create a **local** Laravel installation Web API which will store all of the products, categories and attributes.
This Laravel web API will then hook up to a web application to display these products. You import the `product.csv` and also the `category.csv` into Laravel 

### Requirements

* The project will need to be developed locally and ideally containerized.

* Laravel will need to store products and categories in its own database. (using migrations)

* Products will need to be related to categories (1-M relationship).
